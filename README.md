n8willis fontscripts
====================

This repository holds random scripts I've written to make
life infintessimally more tolerable -- for myself -- while
working on font-design and/or -engineering projects.

They're probably not going to be useful to anyone else.

If and when I clean them up enough so that I'm not
embarrassed-to-the-point-of-a-murder/suicide-pact at the
notion of anyone else seeing them, I'll add items to the
repository on an incremental basis.  But there isn't a roadmap
or a help file.

Any comments about my Python-coding skills will earn you a
spot on my Nixon-style Enemies List. You don't want that; trust me.
